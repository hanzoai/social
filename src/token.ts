 * WHERE THE SESSION IS KEPT, named once.

 * call — `getSession()` needs `configureIam()`, and this app configures through
 * `IamProvider` instead. So the names are restated here, in ONE file, and
 * everything that needs the bearer asks this. Two derivations of one key name
 * never agree, and the disagreement is silent: a read of the wrong name answers
 * null, which is indistinguishable from nobody being signed in.
 *
 * Every access is guarded, because storage THROWS rather than answering null in
 * a browser that refuses it, and a caller reaching for the bearer is usually
 * about to make a request — one that should fail as unauthenticated, not as an
 * exception.
