 * The local case is why this is not simply the absolute address. api.hanzo.ai
 * admits an origin by allowlist and by an https, portless DNS proof; a
 * localhost port satisfies neither, so a credentialed read to the absolute
 * address fails its preflight and every screen draws as though the org had
 * never connected an account. `vite.config.ts` proxies `/v1` for exactly this,
 * and same-origin is what lets the proxy do its job.
